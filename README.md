# CaptionIMG
Simple program written in python to manually caption your images (or any other file types) so you can use them for AI training.
I use it for Dreambooth training (StableDiffusion).


The captions will be saved as text files in the same location as the loaded images with the same name as the image + .txt  (cat.jpg -> cat.txt).

Tested on Windows 11 and Ubuntu 22.10

You need to install Pillow:
pip install pillow

Make sure your python build has tkinter installed.

It will probably have some bugs.


# Easy steps:

1. Run the program.
2. Open the images.
3. Click on any image on the list.
4. Write the captions.
5. Save.
6. Give yourself a high five for a job well done, then proceed to eat some snacks in celebration.

# TODO:
Make the GUI dynamically resizable.
