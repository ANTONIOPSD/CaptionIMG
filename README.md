# CaptionIMG
Simple program to manually written in python to caption your images (or any other file types) so you can use them for AI training, I use it for Dreambooth (StableDiffusion).

The captions will be saved as text files in the same location as the loaded images.

Easy steps:

1. Run the program.
2. Open the images.
3. Click on any image on the list.
4. Write the captions.
5. Save.
6. Give yourself a high five for a job well done, then proceed to eat some snacks in celebration.
